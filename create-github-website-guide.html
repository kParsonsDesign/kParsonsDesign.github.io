<h1>How to Create your own Website in GitHub</h1>
<p>Want to create a portfolio website, but don't want to deal with your own web hosting? GitHub is a great option to create a web page that you can share with others, especially for those interested in coding and software.</p>
<p>This tutorial will walk you through all the steps to create a personal portfolio page to showcase your work.</p>

<h3>Steps to create a website on GitHub</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Create a GitHub account</li>
	<li>Create a repository</li>
	<li>Upload your files to your repository</li>
</ol>	

<h2>Create an Account on GitHub</h2>
<p>The first thing you need to do is create an account on GitHub.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com</a> in your favorite web browser. Enter the email address you want associated with your new account in the sign up field and then click the green, "Sign up for GitHub" button.</p>
<p>Next, make sure you enter a strong password.</p>
<p>Last, pick a username for your account. <strong><span style="color: red;">Warning:</span> Choose your username carefully!</strong> This will be publicly displayed and <em>will be the URL for your public website.</em></p>

<h2>Create a Repository for your Website</h2>
<p>After creating your account you need to create a repository to hold your files. This is where you create the area for your public website.</p>
<p>From your account Overview page, click on the Repositories tab. Or click on the plus symbol at the top right of any GitHub page when you are signed in and select the "New Repository" option.</p>

<h3>Naming your new repository</h3>
<p>The name for your new repository is extremely important. It must take the format <code>&lt;username&gt;.github.io</code>. Example: <code>kparsonsdesign.github.io</code>. <strong>Make sure the user name you type in matches your account user name exactly.</strong> If you have a typo or just choose something different you can use the repository, but your page won't be available on the internet.</p>

<h2>Add Content to your Repository</h2>
<p>The last basic step to complete your website is to add your files to your repository. </p>

<p>Create a simple index.html file on your computer that will be your home page. It should at least have some content in it so you can see it from your web browser after you upload it.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a very simple html file with an image included.</p>

<p><pre><html>
  <h1>Your Portfolio Title</h1>
  <img src="./your_portfolio_image.jpg" />
</html></pre></p>

<h3>Upload your files to GitHub</h3>

<p>After you've created the files to start your website, you need to upload them to GitHub.</p>

<p>The simplest way to upload files is to navigate to your repository page in GitHub. Click on the Repositories tab and select your website repository. Then click the "Add file" button and select "Upload files".</p>

<p>Now you are on the uploading page and can drag files from your file manager to add them into your repository. At least one of the files must be an index.html (or index.md) file to create your public website. When you are done selecting all the files you want to upload you have to "Commit" them to GitHub.</p>

<p>Because GitHub uses version control to keep track of any changes you make to your projects you have to "commit" them. Otherwise they won't save to your repository.</p>

<p>To commit your files to your repository, type in a short description of what this commit does in the present tense. (Example: Uploads index.html) This description lets you know what this particular change did to your code. It might not seem important on this first upload, but after hundreds and thousands you will be glad to know what each change is meant to do. Lastly, select the green "Commit changes" button at the bottom of the page to add your new files to your repository.</p>

<p>Your new website can now be viewed at https://username.github.io.</p>

<blockquote>One thing to note: <strong>GitHub pages do not publish instantaneously.</strong> After you make a commit, GitHub processes it in the background before it goes live.</blockquote>

<p>If you are not sure if your new changes should be visible or not, navigate to the Settings tab from within your repository. Then click on "Pages" in the left navigation bar. If there is a blue bar at the top of the page, GitHub is still processing and your changes are not yet live. Give it a minute.</p>
